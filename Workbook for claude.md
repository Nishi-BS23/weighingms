Build the Weighing MS Step by Step Using specs.md
Hands-on AI-DLC Participant Workbook
0. What You Are Going to Build
You are going to build a functional Weighing MS Assisted Dyestuff Weighing Station.
You are given two source artifacts:
docs/
├── brief.md
└── customize-weighing-station.html 
brief.md is the Product Brief.
customize-weighing-station.html is the supplied UI/UX prototype.
Your job is to turn these into a working application using specs.md AI-DLC.
The final application must reproduce the functional experience represented by the supplied UI/UX.
The real external systems are not available.
Therefore, you will build and use Dummy APIs for:
OrgaTEX
Weighing Scale
Scanner
Printer 
The Dummy APIs are part of your product.

Working Product 
This is the AI-DLC flow implemented by specs.md.
The current specs.md documentation describes AI-DLC as three sequential phases:
Inception
Construction
Operations
With comprehensive checkpoints and traceability. (⁠GitHub)

2. Rules of the Lab
Follow these rules throughout the exercise.
Rule 1 — Do not start coding immediately
The first job is to understand and specify the product.
Rule 2 — Do not invent requirements silently
If something is unclear:
Ask
→ Record
→ Decide
→ Continue 
Rule 3 — AI proposes; you validate
When the AI generates an artifact, you review it.
Do not approve of something simply because it looks professional.
Rule 4 — Do not bypass checkpoints
AI-DLC uses explicit human validation checkpoints. The framework is designed so that the AI waits for human approval rather than automatically advancing. (⁠DeepWiki)
Rule 5 — Dummy integrations are real development artifacts
Do not hard-code fake data directly into the UI.
Use APIs.
Rule 6 — The final application must be demonstrable
A final screenshot is not enough.
You must demonstrate the complete workflow.

PART A — BOOTSTRAP
STEP 0 — Create the Project
Goal
Create an empty Git repository for WeighingMS.
Do this
Open your terminal.
Run:
mkdir weighingms
cd weighingms
git init 
Verify:
git status 
You should see
A Git repository with no committed files yet.
Evidence
Capture:
STEP-00-git.png 
Your evidence must show:
current directory
git status
repository initialized

STEP 1 — Add the Product Sources
Goal
Put the two supplied source artifacts into the project.
Create:
mkdir -p docs 
Copy the supplied files into:
docs/brief.md
docs/customize-weighing-station.html 
Your project should now look like:
weighingms/
├── .git/
└── docs/
    ├── brief.md
    └── customize-weighing-station.html 
Verify
Run:
ls -la docs 
Then:
git status 
Evidence
Submit:
STEP-01-files.png 

STEP 2 — Install specs.md
Goal
Install the specs.md framework and select the AI-DLC flow.
The current specs.md Quick Start requires Node.js 18+ and an AI coding tool such as Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot or Google Antigravity. The documented installation command is npx specsmd@latest install. (⁠GitHub)
Verify Node
Run:
node --version 
You need Node.js 18 or higher.
Install specs.md
Run:
npx specsmd@latest install 
When asked:
Select a development flow 
choose:
AI-DLC - Full methodology with DDD (comprehensive checkpoints) 
The installer detects your AI coding tool and installs the corresponding agent definitions and slash commands. (⁠GitHub)
Verify
Run:
cat .specsmd/manifest.yaml 
Then:
ls .specsmd/aidlc/agents/ 
You should see the AI-DLC agents.
Evidence
Submit:
STEP-02-installation.png
STEP-02-manifest.txt 

STEP 3 — Verify the AI-DLC Agents
The four AI-DLC agents are:
/specsmd-master-agent
/specsmd-inception-agent
/specsmd-construction-agent
/specsmd-operations-agent 
The official repository documents these as the AI-DLC agent entry points. (⁠GitHub)
Open your AI coding tool
Use the AI coding tool configured by specs.md.
For this workbook, examples use Claude Code-style slash commands.
Run
/specsmd-master-agent 
Then say:
Analyze the current project and explain where I am in the AI-DLC lifecycle.

Do not create or modify any project artifact yet. 
Evidence
Capture the response:
STEP-03-master-agent.png 

STEP 4 — Open the specs.md Dashboard
Open another terminal.
Run:
npx specsmd@latest dashboard 
The dashboard provides a visual view of the flow state. The current documentation also provides dashboard-cli if you prefer a terminal dashboard. (⁠GitHub)
Evidence
Submit:
STEP-04-dashboard.png 

Define the Tech Stack Standard:
Before Inception, have the agent recommend the stack, approve it

PART B — INCEPTION
The Inception phase converts the product idea into a structured development model.
You will create:
Intent
Requirements
System Context
Units
Stories
Bolts 
The AI-DLC memory-bank structure stores these artifacts under memory-bank/. (⁠GitHub)

STEP 5 — Ask the Master Agent to Explain the Current State
Run:
/specsmd-master-agent 
Enter:
Analyze the current WeighingMS project.

The project contains:

docs/brief.md
docs/customize-weighing-station.html

Tell me:

1. What source material is available?
2. What phase of AI-DLC should we be in?
3. What artifact should be created next?
4. What information is still unknown?

Do not create the next artifact yet. 
Expected outcome
The AI should recognize that:
No Intent
→ Pre-Inception 
The framework determines project state from the artifacts in memory-bank/. (⁠DeepWiki)
Evidence
STEP-05-context-analysis.png 

STEP 6 — Create the WeighingMS Intent
Goal
Create the first AI-DLC artifact.
Run:
/specsmd-inception-agent 
Then provide:
We are building WeighingMS, an Assisted Dyestuff Weighing Station.

Use these source artifacts:

docs/brief.md
docs/customize-weighing-station.html

Create the project Intent.

The final product must reproduce the functional experience represented by the supplied UI/UX.

The product must use Dummy APIs for:
- OrgaTEX
- weighing scales
- scanner
- printer

Do not invent real external API contracts.

Where the Product Brief contains unresolved questions, identify them explicitly.

Do not begin implementation.

Create the Intent and stop at the appropriate human validation checkpoint. 
The Inception Agent is responsible for intent capture, requirements elaboration and decomposition. (⁠DeepWiki)
Find the generated artifact
Look inside:
memory-bank/intents/ 
The project should now have an Intent directory.
Evidence
Submit:
STEP-06-intent.png
STEP-06-intent-file.png 
CHECKPOINT 1 — Validate the Intent
STOP.
Read the generated Intent.
Do not continue until you agree that it represents the product.
Check:
[ ] Business problem is correct
[ ] Primary user is correct
[ ] Desired outcome is correct
[ ] Scope is reasonable
[ ] UI/UX is included as a source
[ ] Dummy integrations are included
[ ] Unknowns are identified 
If something is wrong, tell the agent what must change.
Example:
The Intent is incorrect.

The system is not intended to replace OrgaTEX.
WeighingMS is the weighing station application and OrgaTEX remains the upstream/downstream production system.

Revise the Intent accordingly. 
When satisfied:
APPROVE INTENT 
Evidence
STEP-06-GATE-APPROVED.png 

STEP 7 — Elaborate Requirements
Run:
/specsmd-inception-agent 
Tell it:
Continue from the approved WeighingMS Intent.

Create the detailed Requirements.

Use:

docs/brief.md
docs/customize-weighing-station.html
approved Intent

Requirements must cover the complete functional product:

1. Batch queue
2. Batch selection
3. Recipe loading
4. Component identification
5. Dyestuff lot
6. Container
7. Tare
8. Scale selection
9. Live weight
10. Target quantity
11. Remaining quantity
12. Tolerance
13. Confirmation
14. Overshoot
15. Component progression
16. Batch completion
17. OrgaTEX write-back
18. Ticket generation
19. Operator traceability
20. Scale/scanner/printer failure

Separate:
- confirmed requirements
- assumptions
- unresolved questions
- training-only dummy behaviour.

Do not invent real OrgaTEX contracts.

Create the requirements artifact and stop at the human validation checkpoint. 
The current AI-DLC flow describes Inception as the stage where requirements are elaborated before decomposition. (⁠GitHub)
Evidence
STEP-07-requirements.png 
CHECKPOINT 2 — Validate Requirements
Read the requirements.
For each requirement ask:
Can I understand what the system must do?
Can I test it?
Can I trace it to the Product Brief or UI? 
If not, ask the agent to revise it.
When satisfied:
APPROVE REQUIREMENTS 
Evidence
STEP-07-GATE-APPROVED.png 

STEP 8 — Convert the UI/UX Into Development Knowledge
The supplied HTML is not just a picture.
It contains:
screens
components
states
data
interaction logic
simulation behaviour
business assumptions
The prototype itself contains three major views:
1 · Select batch
2 · Weigh
3 · Confirm & print 
and the weighing behaviour includes tolerance states, scale switching, component progression and overshoot behaviour.
Give the agent the UI analysis task
Run:
/specsmd-inception-agent 
Enter:
Analyze docs/customize-weighing-station.html as a functional prototype.

Do not redesign it.

Extract the information required to build the product:

1. Screen inventory
2. UI components
3. User actions
4. Application states
5. Data displayed
6. Data required
7. State transitions
8. Validation behaviour
9. Integration points
10. Business rules embedded in JavaScript
11. Assumptions represented by the prototype
12. Questions that the prototype cannot answer

Map each finding back to the supplied prototype where possible.

Do not implement code. 
Evidence
Create a submission containing:
STEP-08-ui-analysis/
├── screen-inventory.png
├── component-inventory.png
├── state-model.png
└── ai-analysis.png 


STEP 9 — Create System Context
Run:
/specsmd-inception-agent 
Tell it:
Using the approved WeighingMS Intent and Requirements, create the System Context.

Include:

Human actors:
- Operator
- Supervisor

Systems:
- WeighingMS
- OrgaTEX

Devices:
- Scale
- Scanner
- Printer

Training substitutes:
- Dummy OrgaTEX API
- Dummy Scale API
- Dummy Scanner
- Dummy Printer

Show:
- inbound data
- outbound data
- ownership
- integration boundaries
- failure boundaries

Clearly distinguish the real conceptual systems from their training-time dummy implementations. 
Evidence
Submit:
STEP-09-system-context.png
STEP-09-system-context.md 

STEP 10 — Decompose the Product Into Units
Now we move from requirements to independently developable capabilities.
Run:
/specsmd-inception-agent 
Enter:
Using the approved Intent, Requirements and System Context:

Decompose WeighingMS into coherent independently developable Units.

Do not create Units simply because there are three screens.

Evaluate capabilities such as:

- Batch Management
- Recipe & Material Management
- Weighing Station
- Scale Integration
- OrgaTEX Integration
- Ticket & Printing

Determine the final Units from the requirements and dependencies.

For every Unit explain:
- responsibility
- included capabilities
- dependencies
- why it should be a separate Unit
- proposed construction bolt type 
The specs.md Inception flow uses Units as a decomposition layer before Stories and Bolts. (⁠DeepWiki)
Evidence
Submit:
STEP-10-units.png
STEP-10-unit-map.png 
CHECKPOINT 3 — Validate Units
Ask:
[ ] Does every requirement belong to a Unit?
[ ] Are Units capability-oriented?
[ ] Are dependencies understandable?
[ ] Is the Weighing Station treated as more than a screen?
[ ] Are integrations separated appropriately? 
Approve:
APPROVE UNITS 



STEP 11 — Create Stories
Run:
/specsmd-inception-agent 
Tell it:
Create the Stories for the approved WeighingMS Units.

Every Story must:

- provide observable user/system value
- reference its Unit
- reference relevant requirements
- include acceptance criteria
- identify UI/UX impact
- identify API dependencies
- identify test expectations

Stories must collectively deliver the complete supplied WeighingMS UI/UX.

Do not create implementation tasks yet. 
Evidence
Submit:
STEP-11-stories.png 



STEP 12 — Create the Bolt Plan
Run:
/specsmd-inception-agent 
Enter:
Create the complete Bolt Plan for WeighingMS.

Group the approved Stories into executable Bolts.

Respect dependencies.

Use Simple Construction Bolts for appropriate UI/integration/utility work.

Use DDD Construction Bolts where domain-heavy backend work requires the richer stages.

Ensure the final Bolt sequence can produce the complete working application.

For every Bolt provide:
- Bolt ID
- Unit
- Stories
- dependencies
- Bolt type
- expected outcome
- test expectations 
The specs.md documentation distinguishes Simple Construction Bolts for UI/integrations/utilities from DDD Construction Bolts for more domain-heavy work. (⁠DeepWiki)
Evidence
Submit:
STEP-12-bolt-plan.png 
CHECKPOINT 4 — INCEPTION COMPLETE
At this point you should have:
memory-bank/
└── intents/
    └── <your-intent>/
        ├── requirements.md
        ├── system-context.md
        └── units/ 
and:
memory-bank/bolts/ 
with the planned construction work.
The current AI-DLC structure uses memory-bank/standards, memory-bank/intents, memory-bank/bolts and memory-bank/operations. (⁠GitHub)
Final Inception checklist
[ ] Intent approved
[ ] Requirements approved
[ ] UI/UX analyzed
[ ] System context approved
[ ] Units approved
[ ] Stories approved
[ ] Bolt plan approved 
Capture:
STEP-12-INCEPTION-COMPLETE.png 
PART C — CONSTRUCTION
Now we build.
Construction is not:
"AI, build the app." 
Construction is:
Select Bolt
→ Plan
→ Human Review
→ Implement
→ Test
→ Human Review
→ Complete 
AI-DLC Construction uses defined Bolt stages, and the framework’s agents enforce human validation checkpoints. (⁠DeepWiki)

STEP 13 — List the Bolts
Run:
/specsmd-construction-agent 
Ask:
List all WeighingMS Bolts.

Show:
- Bolt ID
- Unit
- Description
- Bolt type
- dependencies
- status
- next executable Bolt 
The Construction Agent provides Bolt listing and Bolt execution/status capabilities. (⁠DeepWiki)
Evidence
STEP-13-bolt-list.png 

STEP 14 — Start the First Bolt
Select the first executable Bolt from the generated plan.
Run:
/specsmd-construction-agent --unit="<EXACT UNIT NAME>" --bolt-id="<EXACT BOLT ID>" 
Do not replace the Unit name with a generic placeholder.
Copy the exact Unit name generated by your project.
Evidence
STEP-14-bolt-start.png
 
STEP 15 — Execute the Bolt Plan Stage
If this is a Simple Construction Bolt, the expected stages are:
Plan
→ Implement
→ Test 
For DDD Construction Bolts, the framework uses:
Model
→ Design
→ ADR
→ Implement
→ Test 
The current specs.md documentation identifies these two Bolt stage models. (⁠DeepWiki)
Your instruction to the agent
Execute the current Bolt.

Start with the current Bolt's required planning stage.

Do not implement yet.

Explain:
1. What will change?
2. Which files will be created/modified?
3. Which requirements and stories are being implemented?
4. Which APIs are involved?
5. How will this be tested?

Stop at the human validation checkpoint. 
Evidence
STEP-15-plan.png 
CHECKPOINT 5 — Approve the Bolt Plan
Review the proposed implementation.
Ask:
Does this plan implement the Story?
Does it respect the existing architecture?
Does it use the agreed APIs?
Does it preserve the UI/UX?
Can I test it? 
If yes:
APPROVE PLAN 
The Bolt Plan is approved.
 Proceed to the Implement stage for the current Bolt.
 Stop at the next human validation checkpoint.

STEP 16 — Build the Dummy Integration Layer
This is the first major construction target.
Goal
Create working APIs for the external dependencies.
You need:
Dummy OrgaTEX
Dummy Scale
Dummy Scanner
Dummy Printer 
The UI must eventually consume these services rather than embedding scenario data directly in components.

Dummy OrgaTEX API
The training application needs at least:
GET /api/batches
GET /api/batches/:batchId
GET /api/batches/:batchId/recipe
POST /api/batches/:batchId/consumption 
Dummy Scale API
At minimum:
GET /api/scales
GET /api/scales/:scaleId/status
GET /api/scales/:scaleId/weight
POST /api/scales/:scaleId/tare 
Dummy Printer API
At minimum:
POST /api/tickets 
Important
These are training contracts, not claims about the real OrgaTEX interface.
The Product Brief’s unresolved integration questions remain unresolved.

STEP 17 — Seed the Dummy Data
The supplied prototype gives us the training scenario.
Use:
Batch
B-24187

Order
SO-9931

Machine
JET-04

Shade
Teal 4C 
The supplied prototype contains five components:
Remazol Brill. Blue RSPL
Remazol Red RB
Remazol Yellow RGB
Sodium Sulphate
Soda Ash 
It also defines different units and scales for these components.
Evidence
Submit:
STEP-17-dummy-data.json
STEP-17-api-response.png 

STEP 18 — Test the Dummy APIs
Before connecting the UI, test each API.
For example:
curl http://localhost:<PORT>/api/batches 
Then:
curl http://localhost:<PORT>/api/batches/B-24187 
Then:
curl http://localhost:<PORT>/api/batches/B-24187/recipe 
Use the actual port produced by your implementation.
Evidence
Submit:
STEP-18-api-tests.txt
STEP-18-api-results.png 

STEP 19 — Connect Batch Selection
The first UI screen is:
1 · Select batch 
The supplied UI displays a batch queue including:
B-24187
B-24188
B-24190
B-24191 
Requirement
The screen must obtain its data from:
GET /api/batches 
When the user selects B-24187:
GET /api/batches/B-24187 
Then:
GET /api/batches/B-24187/recipe 
Do not
Hard-code:
const batches = [...] 
inside the UI.
Evidence
Submit:
STEP-19-batch-screen.png

Supervisor Override 
Build it using the specification
Do not copy the original JavaScript implementation.
Use your approved requirements and architecture.
Evidence
Capture:
STEP-20-weigh-screen.png 

STEP 21 — Connect the Scale API
The UI must now obtain the current weight from the Dummy Scale API.
Example:
GET /api/scales/scale-3kg/weight 
The exact API structure should be whatever was approved in your API contract.
Demonstrate
Yellow RGB
→ 3 kg precision

Sodium Sulphate
→ 32 kg floor 
The supplied prototype explicitly switches between these scale configurations.
Evidence
STEP-21-scale-switch.png
STEP-21-scale-api.png 

STEP 22 — Implement Tolerance
For Yellow RGB the supplied scenario uses:
Target = 94.0 g
Tolerance = ±0.5 g 
The UI therefore has:
93.5 g → 94.5 g 
as the tolerance range.
Your application must demonstrate
Below tolerance
93.4 g
→ cannot confirm 
Boundary
93.5 g
→ can confirm 
Target
94.0 g
→ can confirm 
Upper boundary
94.5 g
→ can confirm 
Over
94.6 g
→ cannot confirm 
Evidence
Submit automated tests.
STEP-22-tolerance-tests.txt
STEP-22-tolerance-ui.png 

STEP 23 — Implement Component Progression
The completed components must progress:
Blue RSPL
↓
Red RB
↓
Yellow RGB
↓
Sodium Sulphate
↓
Soda Ash 
The supplied UI represents this as a five-component recipe.
Requirements
A component cannot be marked complete unless its weight is valid.
The batch cannot complete until all components are complete.
Evidence
Create a continuous screen recording:
STEP-23-five-component-demo.mp4 

STEP 24 — Implement Overshoot
The supplied prototype deliberately represents overshoot as a business question.
Do not simply copy its proposed calculation.
Instead, create a decision:
Observed problem
↓
Business rule
↓
Implementation
↓
Test 
Ask the AI
Review the approved WeighingMS requirements and the supplied prototype's overshoot behaviour.

Identify exactly what is known and what is assumed.

Propose two or three safe training implementations for surplus handling.

Do not silently choose one.

Explain the impact of each option.

Stop for human decision. 
You decide
Record your selected training rule.
Example:
For this training implementation, an overweight component remains
unconfirmed and the operator must use the defined recovery action.
No automatic recipe recalculation will be performed unless explicitly
specified by the approved business rule. 
Use whatever rule the team actually approves.
Evidence
STEP-24-overshoot-decision.md

STEP-24-overshoot-ui.png 

STEP 25 — Implement Confirmation
The supplied UI only enables confirmation when the weight is within tolerance.
Implement:

 STEP 31 — Check the AI-DLC Project State
Run:
/specsmd-master-agent 
Ask:
Analyze the current WeighingMS AI-DLC project state.

Report:

1. Intent status
2. Requirements status
3. Unit status
4. Story status
5. Bolt status
6. Outstanding work
7. Any status inconsistencies
8. Whether the project is ready for final validation

Do not modify anything. 
The analyze-context capability uses the artifact hierarchy to determine the project phase and checks status integrity across Intent → Units → Stories → Bolts. (⁠DeepWiki)

Evidence
STEP-32-final-dashboard.png 

STEP 33 — Final Human Validation
This is the final gate.
Do not ask:
“Did the AI finish?”
Ask:
“Did we build the product we intended to build?”
Validate against five sources
1. Product Brief
Does the product solve the defined problem?
2. UI/UX
Does the working application reproduce the intended experience?
3. Requirements
Does every approved requirement have an implementation?
4. Acceptance Criteria
Can every important behaviour be demonstrated?
5. Tests
Can the behaviour be proven automatically?

STEP 34 — Create the Final Evidence Matrix
Create:
FINAL-EVIDENCE.md 
Use:
Requirement | UI | API | Code | Test | Evidence | Result
Batch queue | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |  | 
Batch selection | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |  |

WORKING PRODUCT 
That is the point of the exercise.
The participant should finish with both:
A working WeighingMS 
and:
A traceable AI-DLC evidence trail explaining
why and how that product was built. 
The current specs.md architecture is explicitly designed around file-based artifacts, persistent context, specialized agents and human checkpoints rather than one-shot AI code generation. (⁠DeepWiki)

One Final Rule for the Participant
Never ask the AI to “build the whole application.”
Instead:
Ask the AI to execute the next approved Bolt.
That single discipline is what turns this from an AI coding demo into an AI-DLC hands-on lab using specs.md.
The workbook above is now deliberately execution-first: the participant starts with the supplied brief.md and HTML, installs specsmd, enters the AI-DLC flow, creates and approves the artifacts, executes the generated Bolts, builds the Dummy APIs, and ends with the functional UI/UX plus evidence.
I also verified the current specs.md repository rather than relying on the earlier DeepWiki interpretation: the current Quick Start specifies npx specsmd@latest install, AI-DLC selection, memory-bank/ artifacts, and the four AI-DLC agents; it also explicitly documents that AI-DLC has comprehensive checkpoints.
